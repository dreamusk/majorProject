Nowadays swimming pools are everywhere, Like in homes, restaurant, clubs. There will be 
lifeguard at every pool and many swimmers in the swimming pool also, but after that also there are 
many number of drowning incidents. And the numbers are increasing day by day. To protect the 
people from drowning in swimming pool, we are using machine learning and mesh lifting system 
to prevent drowning incidents. The system will contain a mesh which will help the drowning person 
to lift up in the water, this mesh movement will be controlled by the servo motors which are 
connected to the Arduino Uno board, and there will be buzzer and led indication that will alert the 
people near swimming pool and. The drowning person is detected machine learning, using camera 
which is trained to detect these kind of situations, the camera is connected to the pc or laptop, this 
system is used to monitor the swimming pool, track swimmers in that, if any person is in drowning 
condition system will detect it and it will send command to Arduino Uno board to lift the mesh up. 
With the help of servo motors .The mesh will lift up along with the drowning person

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
install anaconda 
open the anaconda terminal 
install all the requires dependencies 
the code file save in the path of the anconda 
cd to open file in the anaconda terminal
insert the cable is the cpu and then run the commmands in the anaconda terminal 
python main.py

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
botfather configuration in the python file first 
create the bot by typing botfather in telegram after that type /newbot
once you followed necessary action now you could easily got the token id and now chatid remain
for chat id vist https://api.telegram.org/bot5883766043:AAEWt8VrR_-pMehPe1FYd1zOKf_oMMY33Ug/getUpdates 
this is the link for SwimSafe but for anyother bot you will require 
https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-bot-token>/getUpdates this syntax
after visting the link click on restart 
/start in your created bot i.e SwimSafe
now you will get the chat id now put this all in the python file and your bot is ready if any object is 
missing than message will be sended
